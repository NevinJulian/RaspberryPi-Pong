# Pong with Raspberry Pi and Explorer 700

To-do:
- Startup screen so that the game doesn't start immediately. Maybe use the joystick button to start the game.
- Prettier High Score screen.
- Sound effects for game over and reaching high score (different melodies).
- Incorperate LEDs in some way (when the ball hits the paddle, when the ball hits the wall, etc).
